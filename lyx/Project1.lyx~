Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern astronomy relies on Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) and other such
 imaging sensors for recording astronomical data.
 All of these technologies rely on photons exciting the electrons in some
 semiconducting material.
 Counting those electrons becomes a proxy for the number of photons detected.
 Because of this, recording astronomical data is a counting problem, and
 thus we can expect the number of photons recorded on a CCD to be distributed
 as a Poisson distribution.
 As with all electronic measurements, we must also be aware of sources of
 noise.
 Since the noise appears in our counts, we can also expect it to be distributed
 as a Poisson distribution.
 However, the rate at which noise occurs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

, and the rate at which photons fall onto the detector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{star}$
\end_inset

, depend nontrivially on other confounding factors.
 We model detector noise and atmospheric seeing to determine when we can
 distinguish between an astronomical signal and a noise source.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are able to characterize the average noise on a detector, that
 doesn't mean we will know 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

 exactly throughout the entire observation.
 For instance, changing dome conditions or poorly maintained equipment can
 cause nontrivial changes to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

.
 For our present purposes, we will model how the noise characteristics of
 the detector vary with temperature.
 Because we are dealing with a semiconducting system, how the electrons
 are distributed in energy depends on the Fermi-Dirac distribution (Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FermiDirac"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P\left(E\right)=\frac{1}{1+\exp\left(\left(E-E_{F}\right)/k_{B}T\right)}\label{eq:FermiDirac}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For silicon, the band gap is about 
\begin_inset Formula $1.12\,eV$
\end_inset

 and the Fermi energy is approximately half of the band gap energy.
 Thus, we can model the average number of noise electrons from this distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose our detector is a single pixel.
 This is a small detector area.
 Because of this, we may be collecting light from an area of the sky of
 a few arcseconds or less.
 The starlight from space must pass through the atmosphere, where thermal
 variations cause the light to stochastically refract.
 This is known as atmospheric seeing.
 While we can measure the average seeing for a night of observation, it
 is a stochastic process and therefore causes the apparent position of an
 object to vary over an exposure.
 With our small detector area, seeing will become a significant factor the
 photon counts we measure.
 A point source of light passing through a circular aperture produces an
 intensity pattern given by the Airy disk (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Airy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), where 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the Bessel function of the first kind, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the radial distance from the observation point to the optical axis,
 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 to the aperture, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the aperture, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the wavelength of light.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I\left(\theta\right)=I_{0}\left(\frac{2J_{1}\left(2\pi aq\lambda^{-1}R^{-1}\right)}{2\pi aq\lambda^{-1}R^{-1}}\right)\label{eq:Airy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Atmospheric seeing also is not completely uncorrelated, since the air currents
 in the atmosphere are continuous.
 There will be some small-scale correlation between the observed positions.
 Therefore, we can model how the image moves by sampling the Airy disk pattern
 using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
