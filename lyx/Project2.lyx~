Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern astronomy relies on Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) and other such
 imaging sensors for recording astronomical data.
 All of these technologies rely on photons exciting the electrons in some
 semiconducting material.
 Counting those electrons becomes a proxy for the number of photons detected.
 Because of this, recording astronomical data is a counting problem, and
 thus we can expect the number of photons recorded on a CCD to be distributed
 as a Poisson distribution.
 As with all electronic measurements, we must also be aware of sources of
 noise.
 Since the noise appears in our counts, we can also expect it to be distributed
 as a Poisson distribution.
 However, the rate at which noise occurs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

, and the rate at which photons fall onto the detector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{star}$
\end_inset

, depend nontrivially on other confounding factors.
 We model detector noise and atmospheric seeing to determine when we can
 distinguish between an astronomical signal and a noise source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem Statement
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are able to characterize the average noise on a detector, that
 doesn't mean we will know 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

 exactly throughout the entire observation.
 For instance, changing dome conditions or poorly maintained equipment can
 cause nontrivial changes to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

.
 For our present purposes, we will model how the noise characteristics of
 the detector vary with temperature.
 Because we are dealing with a semiconducting system, how the electrons
 are distributed in energy depends on the Fermi-Dirac distribution (Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FermiDirac"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P\left(E\right)=\frac{1}{1+\exp\left(\left(E-E_{F}\right)/k_{B}T\right)}\label{eq:FermiDirac}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For silicon, the band gap is about 
\begin_inset Formula $1.12\,eV$
\end_inset

 and the Fermi energy is approximately half of the band gap energy.
 Using this distribution, we can model the number of noise electrons that
 we count, which in turn gives us a distribution for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose our detector is a single pixel.
 This is a small detector area.
 Because of this, we are collecting light from an area of the sky of fractions
 of an arcsecond.
 The starlight from space must pass through the atmosphere, where thermal
 variations cause the light to stochastically refract.
 This random refraction, known as atmospheric seeing, causes the apparent
 position of the star to rapidly change on the sky, which is why the stars
 twinkle.
 While we can measure the average seeing for a night of observation, it
 is a stochastic process and therefore causes the apparent position of an
 object to vary over an exposure.
 With our small detector area, seeing will become a significant factor the
 photon counts we measure.
 A point source of light passing through a circular aperture produces an
 intensity pattern given by the Airy disk (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Airy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the maximum intensity of the source, 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the Bessel function of the first kind, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the radial distance from the observation point to the optical axis,
 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 to the aperture, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the aperture, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the wavelength of light.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I\left(\theta\right)=I_{0}\left(\frac{2J_{1}\left(2\pi aq\lambda^{-1}R^{-1}\right)}{2\pi aq\lambda^{-1}R^{-1}}\right)^{2}\label{eq:Airy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For simplicity, we will consider an observational configuration such that
 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi a\lambda^{-1}R^{-1}=1$
\end_inset

, that is the prefactor of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is unity.

By sampling this intensity pattern at random positions, we can model

Algorithm Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both models, we must eventually perform hypothesis testing.
 In principle, that would mean integrating over all nuisance parameters.
 In practice, we perform Gibbs sampling.
 In Gibbs sampling, this integration is approximated by taking intermediate
 samples of these nuisance parameters according to their own distributions.
 Then, using those samples, we generate samples of our rate parameters and
 feed those rate parameters into a Poisson distribution.
 This final set of Poisson-distributed samples is a simulated set of data
 with these nuisance parameters integrated out.
 We use this when constructing the simulated data for the Log-Likelihood
 Ratio (LLR) of each model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that our computation time remains reasonable, we use 
\begin_inset ERT

 methods wherever possible.
 This includes both array operations and random number generation.

 methods are faster than their pure-Python counterparts because they pass

 implementation.
 Since compiled

 code is much faster than interpreted Python code, using

 affords greater computational speed, which allows us to get away with some
 less efficient methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our noise model, a noise electron is counted if it is excited into the
 conduction band.
 For our purposes, this occurs when the electron's energy is above the Fermi
 level.
 The probability that an electron has this energy is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{detected}=\int_{E_{f}}^{\infty}P\left(E\right)dE
\]

\end_inset

We can easily perform this integral numerically, and do so using Monte Carlo
 integration.
 Since the tail probability in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FermiDirac"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is extremely small, it is sufficient to just integrate up to a reasonable
 upper bound, in our case 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(E-E_{f}\right)/k_{B}T=1$
\end_inset

.
 Once this probability is calculated, we can produce a uniformly-distributed
 number from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 for each free electron in the pixel and decide whether the electron is
 excited or not.
 The total number of excited electrons is our noise rate parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$
\end_inset

.
 For our purposes, we will assume that the number of free electrons is fixed.

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{noise}$

To take samples from Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Airy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we perform Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
 To do so, we randomly walk around the parameter space.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 positions are randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution centered on
 the previous 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 position and with a standard deviation equal to the mean seeing.
 We then evaluate Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Airy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 at the proposed position and the old position and take their ratio, forming
 the acceptance probability.
 We do not need to obtain the Gaussian probability since they are symmetric
 with respect to the old position and the new position.
 By generating a uniformly distributed random number, we accept or reject
 the new position.
 This resulting Markov Chain gives us many samples of position on the Airy
 disk.
 An example of this sampling compared to its analytical counterpart is presented

Finally, we must calculate the LLR.
 Since we do not have the analytic form of the probability of seeing an
 event, we must calculate that numerically.
 To do so, we use our simulation results to form histograms.
 Normalizing the histograms by their integrals turns the bin heights into
 probabilities.
 Using these numerically-calculated probabilities, we can then calculate
 the LLR as usual (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:LLR"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

).
\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

We consider the null hypothesis, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

, to be the case where we only detect noise.
 The alternative hypothesis, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}$
\end_inset

, is when we detect some signal.
 We want to reject the null hypothesis when we are observing an astronomical
 object.

 arcseconds, and a detector temperature of

 Typically, the detector is cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures, so around
 
\begin_inset Formula $77\,K$
\end_inset

 Using that temperature, we find that the distributions are still distinguishabl
e (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 Surprisingly, the two distributions are closer together than they were
 when the temperature was higher.
 This is due to the relatively large number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{star}$
\end_inset

 samples near zero, due to how the Airy disk rapidly decays away from the
 origin.
 Despite this, it appears that atmospheric seeing does not significantly
 impede our ability to distinguish a signal source from noise.

However, we must recognize the limitations of this model.
 In this model, we assumed a single pixel with a very small detecting area.
 Real detector arrays can have a field of view of several arcminutes.
 The image moving off of one pixel, with its small detecting area, doesn't
 affect the measurement as much since the image will move onto a different
 pixel.
 Thus, seeing affects our ability to resolve an image rather than detect
 it.
 Another major limitation is with our noise model.
 We assumed that the number of free electrons in the pixel was fixed.
 This is not realistic, since the number of free electrons in a pixel depends
 on the doping process, which cannot be controlled exactly.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Realistically, this kind of signal and noise modeling does not need to be
 performed for day-to-day astronomy.
 We have seen that it is very easy to distinguish between instrumental noise
 and even a faint signal.
 It is reasonable enough to characterize the mean seeing and the mean noise
 to account for their effects.
 However, this kind of modeling is necessary when designing new instrumentation
 for revolutionary new observational design or when we are planning observations
 near the extremes of our sensitivity limits.
 The methods used in this analysis may be extended to consider two sources
 in the detection area or for radically different intensity patterns.
 Those extensions would allow us to model observing close binary systems
 or observations using a more complicated instrument such as an interferometer
 respectively.
 The methods presented here are
