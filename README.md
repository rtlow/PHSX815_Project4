Determining the position of stars on an image is one of the most importnat problems in astronomy. We determine the position of stars on an image by fitting Gaussian profiles to the image.

## Dependencies

- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

## Example Usage

The executable files are `python/PhotonCounter.py` and `python/PhotonAnalysis.py`, and can be called from the command line with the `-h` flag, which will print the options.

`PhotonCounter.py` generates the simulated image data. The `-Nmeas` and `-Nexp` options allow the user to specify the number of measurements per experiment and the number of experiments respectively.

`PhotonAnalysis.py` calculates the optimal star positions from data generated by `PhotonCounter.py`. The `--input` option lets the user specify the input filename.
